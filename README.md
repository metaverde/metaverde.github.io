site
I need a site but I'm having trouble narrowing my voice.

This isn't the first page I've built, 
but it's the first page where I was determined to make it work the way I want it to.
For example, it really did take days to track down and implememnt the columns.
I'm currently wage-slaving, so the dedication wasn't full-time, but still.

I feel like I forgot what the columns were for though.
It was supposed to be for picture formatting originally, 
then the whole thing morphed into what it is.

The affirmations generator is just a standard JS codebox I found
whilst searching something else, I don't remember what.
Ultimately I want to use my own code and have it function like magic_one/first.py,
plus of course be pretty.

I think the page is way too dark and messy.
The iPhone format sucks balls, surprise surprise,
but the page translates beautifully onto my Samsung.

Also, I discovered disappearing text.
It's in the third column over.
I was trying to make it appear red on the page.
What I got is it turns red as it disappears.

Still trying to figure out something to do with it.

Ok.

So THEN I get the page designed and everything is in its own neat section, right?
Then I discover "style sheets" and learn that certain aspects are supposed to be in the header(?)
and then call particular paragraphs and suchlike, which I can see now will make later editing much easier.
My idea of neat sections turned out to be the opposite. Smh.

I had started to correct some of that,
but then I was back on learning smart contracts,
and I also am not a big fan of how my page looks
so fixing the code seems pointless now.

My next version will pay more attention to details of correct form.

And I think that's pretty much it.
